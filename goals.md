# Goals

## Mission
As a stream viewer,
When I hover any League of Legends item on stream,
I get relevant tooltip displaying the item name and description

## Hackaton goal
Given a League image,
The program will detect automatically all the items in it, and display an overlay on mouseover.

## Stretch goal
Given a League stream,
The program will regularly detect all the items in it, and display an overlay on mouseover.


## Questions to answer:

* What is the Twitch ecosystem for League plugins?
* What is Twitch policy for plugins?
* How hard is it for a stream to add a new plugin?
* Do we have access to Twitch raw video feed?
