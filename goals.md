When I hover any League of Legends item on stream,

## Hackaton goal
Given a League image,
The program will detect automatically all the items in it, and display an overlay on mouseover.

## Stretch goal
Given a League stream,
The program will regularly detect all the items in it, and display an overlay on mouseover.
